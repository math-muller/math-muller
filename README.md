About me
<br/>
<br/>
<p>
I am Passionate programmer & mobile developer. Interested in Flutter, Kotlin, Swift and Java.<br>
I am a very confident person with my plans and goals, and especially with the goals that I set myself, and the main one is always seeking to improve, to be better day after day. I like to keep myself informed and updated, and I always try to learn about what I don't know, and go even deeper into the things I already know.
